## SMARTER TAB COMPLETION & COMMAND HISTORY (Readline / Bash)
## ============================================================

## --- Completion behavior ------------------------------------

# Perform filename and command completion in a case-insensitive way
# Example: `cd Doc<Tab>` → `Documents`
set completion-ignore-case on

# Treat hyphens (-) and underscores (_) as equivalent during completion
# Example: `git-check<Tab>` can match `git_check`
set completion-map-case on

# Show all possible matches immediately when completion is ambiguous
# (instead of requiring a second Tab)
set show-all-if-ambiguous on

# Append a trailing slash when completing symlinked directories
# Helps visually distinguish dirs from files
set mark-symlinked-directories on

# Do not include hidden files (dotfiles) in completion results
# unless the user explicitly types a leading "."
set match-hidden-files off

# Display all completion candidates at once instead of paging
set page-completions off

# If more than this many matches exist, ask before showing them
# Prevents accidental spam on large directories
set completion-query-items 200

# Show file type indicators during completion (similar to `ls -F`)
# Examples: `/` for dirs, `*` for executables
set visible-stats on

# Prevent duplicate text when completing in the middle of a word
# Example:
#   Input:  cd ~/src/mozil|la
#   Result: cd ~/src/mozilla
# Instead of incorrectly duplicating text
set skip-completed-text on


## --- Command history navigation -----------------------------

# Search backward through history for commands matching the current prefix
# Example:
#   Type:   git
#   Press:  ↑
#   Result: cycles through previous `git ...` commands
"\e[A": history-search-backward

# Search forward through history using the same prefix logic
"\e[B": history-search-forward


## --- UTF-8 / Unicode handling -------------------------------

# Allow direct UTF-8 input/output (no escaping like $'\0123')
set input-meta on
set output-meta on
set convert-meta off


## --- Cursor movement & word editing -------------------------
## These bindings make terminal navigation behave more like
## modern editors (VS Code, IntelliJ, macOS text fields)

# Ctrl + ← / → : move by word (shell-level word navigation)
"\e[1;5D": backward-word
"\e[1;5C": forward-word

# Alt/Option + ← / → : also move by word
# (useful when Ctrl is reserved by terminal or multiplexer)
"\e[1;3D": backward-word
"\e[1;3C": forward-word

# Alt/Option + Delete : delete the previous word
# Matches typical editor behavior (macOS/Linux)
"\e[3;3~": kill-word
